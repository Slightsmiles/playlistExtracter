# playlistExtracter
Scripts for automating the process of playlist transfer between music streaming platforms




## Motivation

I can save money on my girlfriends streaming uwu. Since the Apple Developer Program costs ~100$, this will be done in a slightly more roundabout way than just using the API.


## Generalizability

This most likely won't generalize well, as i will scrape the playlists contents from the web :'(
